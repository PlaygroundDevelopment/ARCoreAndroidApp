# ARCore Android App

This is an android application showcasing features in Google's ARCore library for augmented reality.

The app allows users to place an individual item selected from the recycle view list at the bottom, when a new one is selected the old one is removed. 

There is an option on the top left hand corner that allows the user to move into environment mode, where they can place multiple items on to the real world anchored to the point they were placed at. 

All the items can be scaled and moved by dragging and pinching. 

A picture can be taken by clicking the picture button which then brings up a toast that allows the user to use another app to see the picture

The app is made in response to a coding challenge posed by CameraIQ
